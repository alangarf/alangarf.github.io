I decided recently that RF was a field I had very little practical knowledge
of. I know the basics, the methods and the general ideas, but I've never
actually put together a circuit other than a pre-purchased kit.

Thanks [Alan Yates](http://www.vk2zay.net) and the guys on twitter I set out to
be a simple RF oscillator. I also really wanted to build something using the
"Manhattan" construction style.

You can see above I'm using the CRO probe to inductively couple with the tank
coil.

I've still got the circuit bouncing around my desk, I'm going to attempt to
build a Direct Conversion receiver with it when I have some time.
