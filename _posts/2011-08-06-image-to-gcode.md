Been playing with some code to convert images to GCode.

Here is a test sample. Not bad I reckon. From 3 metres away it looks like a black and white photo. :)

{% include image file="IMAG0838.jpg" alt="In production." %}
{% include image file="DSC00831.jpg" alt="Close up." %}
{% include image file="DSC00828.png" alt="The finished product." %}
