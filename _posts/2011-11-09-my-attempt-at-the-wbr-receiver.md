What got me started on wanting to increase my RF knowledge was this <a href="http://aa7ee.wordpress.com/2011/07/24/the-wbr-a-simple-high-performance-regen-receiver-for-40m-by-n1byt/">article by Dave Richards</a>. I was originally looking for interesting ways to make project cases and happened to find his glorious "double-sided PCB case" technique. The technique has been around for a while, but the circuit he built in it was just so pretty I had to have a go. His little story about using shortwave radio as a kid piqued my interests enough to actually sit down and build one.

So here are some short videos of my attempts at the WBR receiver originally designed by N1BYT.

Once again <em>many</em> thanks to the guys on Twitter for their assistance. It turned out I had a bunch of dodgy MPF102 j-fet transistors which hampered my initial testing.

It's a fun little project and well worth the effort.
