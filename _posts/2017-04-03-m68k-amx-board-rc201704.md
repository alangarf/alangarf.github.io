title: Beeping out the board - Retro Challenge 2017/04
thumbnail: "/assets/images/2017-03-31/m68k.png"

---

I first started with this board by pulling off the ROMs and dumping their contents. Being a m68k CPU generally the ROMs are split into odd and even byte streams, and in order to dissassemble them the two ROM images need to be interleaved again. I achieved this with a little bit of python:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3

import os
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("odd_file")
parser.add_argument("even_file")
parser.add_argument("output")
args = parser.parse_args()

with open(args.output, 'wb') as out:
  with open(args.odd_file, 'rb') as odd:
    with open(args.even_file, 'rb') as even:

      odd.seek(0, os.SEEK_END)
      odd_size = odd.tell()

      even.seek(0, os.SEEK_END)
      even_size = even.tell()

      if (odd_size != even_size):
        exit("ROM images aren't the same size!")

      odd.seek(0)
      even.seek(0)

      for c in range(0, odd_size):
        odd.seek(c)
        even.seek(c)

        out.write(odd.read(1))
        out.write(even.read(1))
```

# ROMing around like it's 1995

I took the two ROM images I dumped and merged them back together using the following:

```
$ merge.py rom_odd.bin rom_even.bin rom_out.bin
```

After verifying the `rom_out.bin` using `objdump` for the m86k I knew I was on my way.

```
$ m68k-linux-gnu-objdump --disassemble-all --target=binary --architecture=m68k --start-address=0x00 rom_out.bin
```

This gave me the disassembled output of the m68k ROM image:

```
rom_out.bin:     file format binary


Disassembly of section .data:

00000000 <.data>:
       0:	0002 0ff0      	orib #-16,%d2
       4:	0000 0400      	orib #0,%d0

[SNIP]
```

The first value is the preset value the CPU uses for the SP (stack pointer). So
it looks like it's up in 0x20000 address space. That's a good start, looks like
some RAM is up around 0x20000.

The second address is the init jump point, so the first instruction the CPU
will load is at location 0x400.

# The stuff you see in ROM dumps ...

Further digging through the assembly and looking at hex dumps you can start to
see strings (even some funny stuff) and loops testing devices and memory etc.

# Beep, beep, beeeeeeeeeep ...

After much looking through the code I had some good ideas where things were but I still didn't fully understand the address map of the CPU and what devices were going where. So being all DIP packages and only a dual layer board I set out with my Fluke 87 and my pointest of pointy probes and started beeping out traces on the board to get a true account of where all the devices are and what they do.

I start building up a picture in KiCad of the schematic. Not taking values of components etc, but just the general connections so that many things can become much clearer. I first tackled the address decoding.

[![AMX AXC 68000 address decoding](/assets/images/2017-04-03/tmb_address-decoding.png)](/assets/images/2017-04-03/address-decoding.png)

So after a lot of beeping and probing I got the address map out:

```
| 0x00000       | ROM                    |
| 0x10000       | ROM (addr alias?)      |
| 0x20000       | RAM BANK 1             |
| 0x30000       | RAM BANK 2             |
| 0x40000       | UARTs (2 x SCC2691)    |
| 0x50000       | INPUTs via a 74LS373   |
| 0x60000       | OUTPUTs via a 74LS259  |
| 0x70000       | INPUT via a 74LS373    |
```

The first INPUT and OUTPUT addresses are related to the OKI M5832 clock calendar chips 4 bit I/O bus and control lines, and the on-board green status LED. So that's a good start.

Need to understand the UARTs a little better, one is standard RS232 the other is a weird RS485 like interface (called AXLink in AMX speak).

Anyway, that's all for today. I'll crack on with more tomorrow!
