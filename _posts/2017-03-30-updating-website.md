Yes my website is being updated once again.

After about 5 aborted attempts to rebuild all my old content and get this site up and going again. I've finally decided to just start making new content, and if I find the time (and the will) I'll periodically rebuild the old stuff. The mountain of work to convert (and fix) all the old content was always the largest hurdle to getting this site going again. But NO MORE! No more excuses.

I now can write content in vim, push it to github and it's done. No wordpress, no VPS to admin, no image libraries to update (actually I still have that problem dang it).

Anyway, new year, new content. Who knows it might even stick!

Cheers,

-A.
